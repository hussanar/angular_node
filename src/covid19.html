        <p>
            To better understand the extent of essential health service disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO
            has conducted three rounds of the Global pulse survey on continuity of essential health services during the
            COVID-19 pandemic. This report presents global findings from 129 countries, territories and areas that
            participated in the third round of the survey during November - December 2021. The findings offer critical
            insight from country key informants into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on essential health services,
            the challenges health systems are facing to ensure access to essential COVID-19 tools (including COVID-19
            diagnostics, COVID-19 therapeutics, COVID-19 vaccines and personal protective equipment), and how countries
            are responding to mitigate disruptions, recover services, and strengthen health service resilience over the
            long-term.

            <h2>What is coronavirus?</h2>
            <p>

                Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in humans. They are called
                “corona” because of crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome
                (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the common cold are examples of coronaviruses that
                cause illness in humans.

                The new strain of coronavirus — COVID-19 — was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The
                virus has since spread to all continents.

                <h2>How many people are infected with COVID-19?</h2>
                <p>
                    The number of people infected changes daily. As of this writing (10/11/2021), more than 196,910,000
                    people in the world have been infected. Over 4,850,000 people have died. Some 192 countries and
                    territories on all continents have now reported cases of COVID-19.
                </p>

                    <h2>How does the new coronavirus (COVID-19) spread from person to person?</h2>
                    <p>COVID-19 is likely spread:

                        The virus travels in respiratory droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs,
                        sneezes, talks, sings or breathes near you (within 6 feet). You may be infected if you inhale
                        these droplets.
                        You can also get COVID-19 from close contact (touching, shaking hands) with an infected person
                        and then touching your face.
                        It’s considered possible to get COVID-19 after touching a contaminated surface and then touching
                        your eyes, mouth, or nose before washing your hands. But it’s thought to be unlikely.</p>
